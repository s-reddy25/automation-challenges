Configuration management challenge notes:

I used a simple bash script to accomplish this task. 

1. created script.sh to change the static value to dynamic value
2. created a file (ips.txt) with the list of servers that the template needs to be pushed ( I considered 5 servers)
3. created a push.sh script to place the template and give an output with successful and failure number of servers.
